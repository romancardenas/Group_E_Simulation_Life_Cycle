## Application Overview

This application is meant to support its users through the entire simulation lifecycle. To achieve this, it allows users to:
* submit a workflow file containing a series of operations to build a simulation scenario from geospatial data;
* construct a spatial DEVS simulation model;
* run a simulation using the Cadmium simulator developed at the Advanced Real-Time Simulation (ARS) Laboratory;
* prepare a visualization of the simulation results; and
* visualize the simulation results in the DEVS WebViewer, also developed at the ARS Lab.

A flow chart explaining the flow of the program is presented here.
