## Application Overview

This application is meant to support its users through the entire simulation lifecycle. To achieve this, it allows users to:
* submit a workflow file containing a series of operations to build a simulation scenario from geospatial data;
* construct a spatial DEVS simulation model;
* run a simulation using the Cadmium simulator developed at the Advanced Real-Time Simulation (ARS) Laboratory;
* prepare a visualization of the simulation results; and
* visualize the simulation results in the DEVS WebViewer, also developed at the ARS Lab.

A flow chart explaining the flow of the program is presented [here](https://github.com/romancardenas/Group_E_Simulation_Lifecycle/wiki/1.-Software-Dependencies).

## Getting Started
### 1. Dependencies
We rely on third-party software to run our tool. The main dependencies for each platform are as follows:

**Windows Users** 
* Cygwin 
* GNU C Compiler, Git, Make, and CMake 
* apt-cyg Package Manager 
* Boost Library

**MacOS Users** 
* Command Line Tools 
* Homebrew 
* Boost Library 

**Linux Users**
* GNU C Compiler, Git, Make, and CMake 
* Boost Library 

Detailed instructions about the installation of these dependencies are provided [here](https://github.com/romancardenas/Group_E_Simulation_Lifecycle/wiki/1.-Software-Dependencies).

### 2. Building the Software
Once you have installed all the dependencies, building the application should be straightforward, as we provide a set of shell scripts for automating the process.

1. Open a terminal (Windows users should use a Cygwin terminal) 
2. Download this repository in your home directory and move inside the repository: 
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/romancardenas/Group_E_Simulation_Lifecycle.git
cd Group_E_Simulation_Lifecycle
``` 
3. Run the `setup.sh` shell script to download third-party repositories and build the software. Use the `-b` flag to make a complete build:
```
./setup.sh -b
```

Once the process is finished, you should be able to see:
1. a `/build` directory with the `Makefile` generated by CMake
2. a `/bin` directory with all the binaries (main function and tests) generated.

### 3. Testing the Software
After building everything, you may want to run some tests to make sure that everything works as expected. You have two options:
1. Use `make` to run the tests:
```
cd build
make test
```
2. Run the `run_tests.sh` shell script:
```
./run_tests.sh
```
If you want to store the test results in a file (e.g., the `test_results.txt` file), you can type the following command:
```
./run_tests.sh > test_results.txt
```
### 4. Running the Main Application

To run the application, type the following commands

```
cd bin
sim_lifecycle RELATIVE_PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_JSON_FILE
```

Where `RELATIVE_PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_JSON_FILE` corresponds to the relative path from the `bin/` folder to the JSON file containing all the simulation workflow fields.

You **must** run the main application from the `bin/` folder. All the file paths included in your workflow JSON file must be relative to this folder. Otherwise, the application won't be able to find the desired files.

We provide a set of valid workflow JSON files in the `data/` folder. For example, you can run a simple model as follows:

```
cd bin
sim_lifecycle ../data/toy_workflow.json
```

The simulation output of this workflow example will be stored in the `data/results/` folder.
